## Thursday: Gold Was ₹17,885 per Gram. Monday: ₹15,153.

That's ₹2,732 gone per gram. In three trading days.

If you bought 100 grams of gold last Thursday (₹17.8 lakh), by Monday it was worth ₹15.1 lakh. **You just watched ₹2.7 lakh disappear.**

Silver? Even more brutal. From ₹4.2 lakh per kg to ₹2.5 lakh per kg. **Down ₹1.65 lakh per kilogram.**

Let me explain what just happened in Indian gold and silver markets, why the Union Budget duty cut didn't prevent this crash, and what you should do if you're planning to buy or already holding.

## The Damage: India's Biggest Gold Crash in Years

All numbers verified from MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange) and reliable market sources.

### **Gold Prices in India**

**MCX Gold Futures (per 10 grams):**
- **Peak (January 29):** ₹1,78,850
- **Sunday crash (Feb 1):** ₹1,38,835 
- **Monday (Feb 2):** ₹1,51,530
- **Three-day fall:** ₹50,000 (26% crash)

**Physical Gold (24-Karat):**
- **Peak:** ₹17,885 per gram
- **Current:** ₹15,153 per gram  
- **Fall:** ₹2,732 per gram

**City-wise Gold Rates (Feb 2, 2026 - per 10g, 24K):**
- Delhi: ₹1,60,570
- Mumbai: ₹1,60,570
- Chennai: ₹1,73,010 (highest)
- Bengaluru: ₹1,60,570
- Hyderabad: ₹1,60,570
- Kolkata: ₹1,60,570

### **Silver Prices in India**

**MCX Silver Futures (per kg):**
- **Peak:** ₹4,20,048 per kg
- **Sunday crash:** ₹2,91,922 per kg (30.5% single-day drop!)
- **Monday:** ₹2,54,364 per kg
- **Total fall:** ₹1,65,684 per kg (39% from peak)

**Physical Silver:**
- **Peak:** ₹4,100 per 10 grams
- **Current:** ₹2,660 per 10 grams
- **Fall:** ₹1,440 per 10 grams

The numbers are shocking. Silver fell **₹26,273 per kilogram in just the first hour** of Sunday's trading session.

## What Happened: The Timeline

Let me break down exactly what happened, day by day.

### **Thursday, January 29**

Gold hit all-time highs. MCX Gold futures touched ₹1,78,850 per 10g. Physical gold in Mumbai crossed ₹17,800 per gram.

Everyone was buying:
- Jewelers stocking up for wedding season
- Investors jumping in (FOMO was strong)
- Traders betting on more gains

The mood was euphoric. WhatsApp groups were buzzing with "gold going to ₹2 lakh per 10g" predictions.

### **Friday, January 30 (Night)**

Global markets opened (US timings). Gold was trading at $5,600 per ounce internationally.

Then news broke: US President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chairman.

Global gold crashed from $5,600 to $4,770 in hours. **Down $830 in one session.**

Indian markets were closed (it was Friday night here), but we knew Sunday was going to be brutal.

### **Saturday, January 31**

Markets closed, but panic spread:
- WhatsApp messages: "Sell gold on Monday!"
- News channels covering the crash
- Jewelers worried about inventory losses
- Investors checking international prices every hour

### **Sunday, February 1 (Special Trading Session)**

MCX opened a special Sunday trading session because Union Budget 2026 was being announced.

What happened was carnage:

**First hour (9:00-10:00 AM):**
- Gold futures fell ₹10,600 per 10g
- Silver fell ₹26,273 per kg
- Lower circuit limits hit multiple times
- Trading halted to control panic

I was watching the MCX screen. Prices were falling so fast that numbers turned red before I could refresh.

**Why Sunday trading?**
MCX opens special sessions before major events (Budget, RBI policy) so traders can react immediately. This time, they reacted with mass selling.

### **Monday, February 2**

Regular trading resumed. Prices bounced slightly but remained down:
- Gold recovered from ₹13,884 to ₹15,153 per 10g
- Silver recovered from ₹2,91,922 to ₹2,54,364 per kg

But the damage was done. Three-day crash: ₹50,000 in gold, ₹1.65 lakh in silver.

## Why Indian Markets Crashed So Hard

India is the world's second-largest gold consumer (after China). Our markets don't crash without reason. Here's why it happened:

### **1. We Follow Global Prices**

Indian gold prices are directly linked to international markets. The formula is simple:

**Indian Price = (International Price in USD × USD/INR Rate) + Import Duty + Handling Costs + Jeweler Margin**

When international gold fell from $5,600 to $4,770, Indian prices had to fall proportionally. There's no escaping it.

### **2. MCX Margin Pressure**

Many traders buy gold futures on margin (leverage). You put ₹1 lakh, control ₹10 lakh worth of gold.

When prices crashed:
- Brokers demanded more margin money
- Traders couldn't pay
- Forced selling began
- Prices fell further
- More margin calls
- More selling

It's a vicious cycle. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses.

### **3. Profit-Taking After Massive Rally**

Gold had rallied ₹50,000 in recent weeks. Many investors who bought at ₹13,000-14,000 per 10g decided to lock in profits when panic started.

Can't blame them. When you're sitting on 25-30% gains and see markets crashing, taking money off the table makes sense.

### **4. Wedding Season Jitters**

February-May is peak wedding season in India. Jewelers had stocked heavily at higher prices (₹17,000-17,800 per gram).

When prices crashed, they faced:
- Inventory losses
- Customers demanding refunds
- Advance orders cancellations

Some jewelers started selling futures to hedge their physical stock, adding to the selling pressure.

### **5. Budget Duty Cut Didn't Help**

Union Budget 2026 (announced Feb 1) reduced gold import duty from 6% to 5%.

In normal times, lower duty = lower prices = good news.

But the ₹3,500 savings from duty cut was completely overshadowed by the ₹50,000 crash from global factors.

It's like getting a ₹500 discount on a shirt while the entire mall is on fire.

### **6. Silver's Industrial Demand Collapse**

Silver fell harder (39% vs gold's 26%) because:

- **Half of silver demand is industrial** (electronics, solar panels, EVs)
- When global growth concerns rise, industrial metal demand falls
- Silver has a smaller, less liquid market (easier to crash)
- More speculative traders in silver = more panic selling

Gold is mostly investment/jewelry (stable demand). Silver has industrial exposure (volatile).

## The Global Trigger (Brief Context)

The crash originated from the US. Here's what happened:

**The Warsh Nomination:**
On January 31, Trump announced Kevin Warsh as his nominee for Federal Reserve Chairman (replacing Jerome Powell in May).

**Why this crashed gold:**
- Warsh is a "hawk" (favors higher interest rates to control inflation)
- Higher interest rates make gold less attractive (gold pays no interest)
- Expectation: Fed won't cut rates aggressively under Warsh
- Result: US dollar strengthened, gold crashed

**The numbers globally:**
- Gold fell from $5,600 to $4,770 per ounce (15% drop)
- Silver crashed from $120 to $81 per ounce (36% drop)
- Worst single-day fall in gold since 2013
- Worst silver crash since 1980

**Why it spread to India:**
We import all our gold. International prices directly affect us. When New York sneezes, Mumbai catches a cold.

## What This Means for Different Types of Gold Buyers

### **For Wedding & Jewelry Purchases**

If you're buying gold for a wedding or festival in the next few months:

**My advice: Wait 2-3 weeks.**

Here's why:
- Markets are still volatile
- Jewelers bought stock at ₹17,000-17,800 per gram
- They won't drop prices immediately (protecting margins)
- In 2-3 weeks, as they clear old inventory and buy fresh stock, better prices will come

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 1 (now): Prices range-bound ₹15,000-15,500 per 10g
- Week 2-3: Prices could drift to ₹14,500-15,000 as old stock clears
- Week 4+: Stabilization around ₹14,000-15,000

If your wedding is 4+ months away, you have time. No need to rush.

**What about advance orders?**

If you placed an advance order last week and paid a token:
- Check if jeweler will honor old price or adjust
- Most reputable jewelers adjust prices (good customer relations)
- If they don't, consider switching jewelers for future purchases

### **For Gold Investors (ETFs, Sovereign Gold Bonds, Physical)**

**If you bought gold in the last week:**
You're sitting on paper losses. It hurts. But:

- Gold is a long-term investment (5+ years horizon)
- 25% corrections are normal in bull markets  
- Your investment thesis hasn't changed (or has it?)
- Don't panic sell at the bottom

**If you were planning to buy gold:**
This crash just gave you a 26% discount. The ₹50,000 fall plus ₹3,500 duty cut means you're getting gold at prices we last saw in December.

But don't rush. Scale in gradually:
- Buy 25% of planned amount now
- Another 25% if it dips to ₹14,000 per 10g
- Hold cash for further falls

**If you're already holding gold (long-term):**
Nothing has changed. Gold didn't become useless overnight. Sit tight.

### **For Silver Investors**

Silver is more volatile than gold. If you're invested:
- Expect more wild swings
- Don't use leverage
- Be prepared for ₹2 lakh per kg level (support)
- Long-term outlook depends on industrial demand recovery

## My Personal Investment Strategy

I invest in Gold ETFs. More transparent, liquid, and cheaper than physical gold for investment purposes.

**What I'm doing right now:**

### **Not Buying Yet (Waiting for Stability)**

Markets need to calm down. I want to see:
- 5-7 days of stable pricing (no 5%+ moves)
- MCX Gold settling in ₹14,500-15,000 range
- Trading volumes normalizing

### **My Planned Approach**

When I do buy, it'll be staged:

**Stage 1 (25% of allocation):** When gold stabilizes around ₹15,000 per 10g for a week

**Stage 2 (25%):** If it falls to ₹14,000 per 10g

**Hold Cash (50%):** For any further weakness or opportunities

This is rupee-cost averaging. I don't try to time the exact bottom. I build positions over time.

### **Why Gold ETFs Over Physical**

For investment (not jewelry), ETFs make more sense:

**Benefits:**
- No making charges (saves 10-12%)
- Instant liquidity (sell on NSE during market hours)
- Can invest small amounts (even ₹1,000)
- Transparent pricing (linked to MCX)
- No storage worries

**Costs:**
- Expense ratio: ~0.5% annually
- Need demat account

**Popular Indian Gold ETFs:**
- HDFC Gold ETF
- SBI Gold ETF
- ICICI Prudential Gold ETF
- Nippon India Gold ETF

All track gold prices. Pick any with good daily trading volumes (liquidity).

### **What I'm Tracking**

**Indian indicators:**
- MCX daily prices and volumes
- Jeweler demand trends  
- Import data (if imports increase = demand returning)

**Global cues:**
- US dollar strength
- Fed policy signals
- International gold ETF flows

## Should You Buy Now? Practical Questions Answered

### **"My wedding is in 3 months. Buy now or wait?"**

Wait 2-3 weeks. Prices will likely drift ₹2,000-3,000 lower as jewelers adjust inventory. Unless you see prices jumping back to ₹16,500+, no urgency.

### **"I bought gold at ₹17,500 last week. Should I sell?"**

No. Unless you desperately need cash. Selling now means booking a ₹2,200 per gram loss. If it's for investment, give it time. Gold recovers over years, not days.

### **"Gold ETF or physical gold?"**

**For investment:** Gold ETF (lower costs, better liquidity)  
**For wedding/jewelry:** Physical gold (no choice)  
**For emergency fund:** Physical in bank locker (accessible without demat/internet)

I personally hold both – physical for emergencies, ETFs for investment.

### **"What if gold falls to ₹12,000 per 10g?"**

It could. That's why you don't invest everything at once. If it falls more, that's an even better entry point (assuming fundamentals haven't changed).

### **"Will the duty cut help prices?"**

Yes, over time. As jewelers clear old inventory (bought at 6% duty) and restock (at 5% duty), prices will adjust downward by ₹3,000-4,000 per 10g. But this takes 2-3 weeks, not overnight.

### **"Is this the bottom?"**

Nobody knows. Markets don't send emails announcing bottoms. That's why staged buying makes sense. You catch part of the recovery without needing perfect timing.

### **"What about Sovereign Gold Bonds?"**

SGBs are excellent for 8-year investments:
- 2.5% annual interest (every 6 months)
- Tax-free gains if held to maturity
- RBI-issued (safest)

But no SGB tranche is open right now. When RBI announces the next issue (usually every 2-3 months), compare the issue price with market price and decide.

## What to Watch in Coming Weeks

I'm monitoring these indicators:

### **MCX Price Levels**

**Gold support:** ₹14,000-14,500 per 10g  
**Gold resistance:** ₹16,000 per 10g

If gold holds above ₹14,000 for a week, worst is likely over.

**Silver support:** ₹2,00,000 per kg  
**Silver resistance:** ₹3,00,000 per kg

Silver needs to reclaim ₹2.5 lakh level to show strength.

### **Wedding Season Demand**

February-May is peak. If retail demand stays strong:
- Jewelers will need to restock
- Import duty at 5% (lower cost)
- Could provide price floor around ₹14,000-14,500

Watch for jeweler association statements and import data.

### **Global Signals**

**US Dollar:** Currently strong. If it weakens, gold benefits.

**Fed Policy:** Warsh's Senate confirmation hearings will signal future rate policy. Less hawkish = good for gold.

**Gold ETF Flows:** Are global investors buying (bullish) or selling (bearish)?

## My Bottom Line

I'll be straight with you. I didn't predict this crash. Nobody I know did.

But here's what I've learned watching Indian gold markets:

**Crashes create opportunities.** Not immediately. Over weeks and months.

**Fundamentals for gold haven't changed:**
- Government deficits still high
- Rupee long-term weakness concerns
- Indians love gold (cultural demand)
- Wedding season supports prices

**For investors:**
- Don't panic sell
- Don't FOMO buy at top
- Build positions gradually
- Think 5+ years, not 5 days

**For wedding buyers:**
- Wait 2-3 weeks for better prices
- Budget duty cut will help eventually
- Don't buy in panic or rush

**What I'm doing:**
- Waiting for volatility to calm
- Planning 25-25-50 staged entry (25% at ₹15K, 25% at ₹14K, keep 50% cash)
- Tracking MCX and global signals
- Not making emotional decisions

**What I'm NOT doing:**
- Panic selling existing holdings
- Trying to catch exact bottom (impossible)
- Using leverage/margin (leverage kills)
- Listening to "gold going to ₹10,000" or "gold going to ₹20,000" noise

Markets move. Prices fluctuate. That's normal. The question is: Will you position yourself to benefit when they recover?

Stay calm. Stay rational.
