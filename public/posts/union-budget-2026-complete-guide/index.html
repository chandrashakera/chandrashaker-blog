Here’s What You Need to Know. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman just presented her 9th consecutive budget yesterday (February 1, 2026) - and fun fact, it’s the first Sunday budget presentation since 1999! I spent the entire evening going through the budget documents, watching the speech, and honestly… it’s a mixed bag.\nAs someone who teaches engineering students and also manages my own investments (Indian stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, US stocks through INDMoney), I wanted to break down what this budget actually means for regular people like us. Not the jargon-heavy analysis you’ll find everywhere else, but a straightforward explanation.\nThe Numbers That Actually Matter Here’s what you should care about:\nWhat Amount My Take Total Budget ₹51 lakh crore Massive, but that’s expected Defence Spending ₹7.85 lakh crore +15% increase - border tensions with Pakistan Infrastructure ₹12.2 lakh crore Good for long-term growth Semiconductor Push ₹40,000 crore Finally! We need this Fiscal Deficit 4.3% of GDP Slightly better than last year The TL;DR: Growth-focused budget with healthcare relief, but no tax cuts for middle class. Some things got cheaper, some got costlier.\nWhat’s Getting CHEAPER (The Good Stuff) 1. Cancer Medicines - This is HUGE Look, I’ve seen colleagues and friends struggle with cancer treatment costs. The financial burden is brutal - often ₹5-15 lakhs annually. So when the FM announced that 17 cancer drugs will now be duty-free, I actually felt relieved for so many families.\nWhat this means in real money:\nBefore: Import duty made these drugs 10-15% more expensive After: Direct savings of ₹50,000 to ₹2 lakh per patient per year Also: 7 more rare diseases added to duty-free list This isn’t just about money - it’s about accessibility. More people can now afford life-saving treatment.\n2. Electronics - Your Next Phone Might Be Cheaper As an electronics professor, I’m pretty excited about this one. The government reduced customs duty on components for manufacturing mobile phones and tablets.\nExpected impact:\nMid-range phones: ₹500-1,000 cheaper Example: A ₹15,000 phone might cost ₹14,000 Microwave ovens: About ₹500-800 cheaper It’s not revolutionary, but hey, every rupee saved counts when you’re buying gadgets for the family.\n3. Gold \u0026 Silver - Wedding Shoppers, Listen Up Import duty dropped from 6% to 5%. Now, I know that sounds tiny, but when you’re buying gold for a wedding, it adds up:\nGold jewelry savings: ₹3,500-4,200 per 10 grams Silver: ₹4,500 cheaper per kg My advice? Wait 2-3 weeks for prices to stabilize. There was a massive global crash in precious metals prices just before the budget (gold fell 11%, silver crashed 35%!). So the timing is actually not bad for wedding shoppers.\n4. Foreign Travel \u0026 Education Got Easier on Your Wallet The TCS (Tax Collected at Source) has been reduced for:\nForeign tour packages Education expenses abroad Medical treatment overseas Real-world example: If you’re sending your kid abroad for education, you’ll pay less TCS upfront. More money in your pocket initially.\n5. Personal Imports - Halved! This is interesting. Customs duty on goods imported for personal use was cut from 20% to 10%.\nPractical scenario: If your relative brings you an iPhone from Dubai, you’ll pay half the duty you used to. Could save ₹10,000-15,000 on high-value items.\n6. Some Other Stuff That Got Cheaper Solar panels (duty cuts on parts) Leather products (raw material duty reduced) EV battery components Textile exports (more time to ship) What’s Getting COSTLIER (The Not-So-Good Stuff) 1. F\u0026O Trading Just Got EXPENSIVE Okay, this one hit me because I dabble in options occasionally (mostly US markets, but still). The Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been increased dramatically:\nWhat Before After Increase Futures 0.01% 0.05% 5x higher Options Premium 0.10% 0.15% 1.5x higher Options Exercise 0.125% 0.15% 1.2x higher Why’d they do this? The government says F\u0026O trading volume is 500 times India’s GDP. That’s… insane. They’re trying to curb excessive speculation.\nImpact on you: If you’re a frequent F\u0026O trader, your costs just jumped significantly. Time to rethink that intraday strategy.\n2. Cigarettes, Tobacco, Alcohol - Sin Taxes Up No surprises here. The government increased excise duty on:\nCigarettes: About ₹5-10 more per pack Pan masala \u0026 tobacco: 10-15% price hike Alcohol: Varies by state, but expect 5-8% increase Honestly? This is probably a good thing from a public health perspective, even if smokers and drinkers won’t be happy.\n3. Corporate Buybacks - Shareholders Now Pay Tax This is technical, but important if you invest in stocks:\nOld system: Company paid tax on buyback\nNew system: Shareholders pay capital gains tax (22% for corporate, 30% for non-corporate)\nWhat it means: Companies might do fewer buybacks, or shareholders get less net benefit.\n4. Some Imported Luxury Goods Professional cameras, TV broadcast equipment, and filmmaking gear will attract higher taxes. The logic? Promote “Make in India” for electronics.\nAlso, fertilizer input costs might rise (duty exemptions removed), though the government subsidizes most of it anyway.\nWhere’s All The Money Going? Alright, here’s where your tax money is being spent. I’ll focus on the big-ticket items:\n1. Defence: ₹7.85 Lakh Crore (+15%) Given the recent tensions with Pakistan, this makes sense. More money for:\nMilitary modernization Border infrastructure Equipment upgrades Personnel welfare As an Indian, I’m okay with this. Security isn’t negotiable.\n2. Infrastructure: ₹12.2 Lakh Crore (+9%) This is where things get interesting. Seven new high-speed rail corridors:\nMumbai-Pune Pune-Hyderabad Hyderabad-Bengaluru Delhi-Varanasi Others… My take: Great for long-term connectivity, but these projects take 5-10 years. Don’t expect high-speed trains next year.\nAlso, focus on Tier-II and Tier-III cities (population \u003e 5 lakh). Smart move - that’s where growth is happening.\n3. Semiconductors: ₹40,000 Crore Finally! India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 is here. We’re going to try and become a chip manufacturing hub.\nWhy this matters: Remember the chip shortage during COVID? Every smartphone, car, and gadget needs semiconductors. Being self-reliant is critical.\nFor students: If you’re in electronics or computer science, semiconductor design is going to be a HOT career field. Companies will be hiring like crazy.\n4. SME Growth Fund: ₹10,000 Crore Small and medium enterprises are getting ₹10,000 crore in funding. Performance-linked incentives, better credit access, cluster development.\nIf you’re a small business owner: Look into this. Could be a game-changer for your business.\n5. Education: ₹1.28 Lakh Crore (+6%) As an educator, I’m cautiously optimistic:\nGirls’ hostels in every district (good!) University townships near industrial hubs Skill development programs expanded But honestly? We need more. Much more. Our education system needs a complete overhaul, not just 6% budget increase.\n6. Rural Employment - This is Controversial MGNREGA (rural employment guarantee scheme) budget was slashed by 65% - from ₹86,000 crore to ₹30,000 crore.\nWhy? They’re transitioning to a new program called VB-G RAM G (allocated ₹95,692 crore).\nConcern: Will the transition be smooth? Farmer groups are already unhappy. This could be politically tricky.\nThe Good, The Bad, and The “Meh” What I Liked ✅ 1. Healthcare Focus 17 cancer drugs duty-free is genuinely helpful. I’ve seen what cancer treatment costs do to families. This will save lives - literally.\n2. Manufacturing Push Semiconductors, electronics components, rare earth corridors - we’re finally serious about becoming a manufacturing hub. About time!\n3. Fiscal Discipline Deficit at 4.3% shows the government isn’t going on a spending spree. Long-term, this is good for economic stability.\n4. Infrastructure Spending ₹12.2 lakh crore on infrastructure = jobs, jobs, jobs. Engineering students graduating in next 2-3 years will have good opportunities.\n5. Digital Push Tax holiday for data centers till 2047! That’s bold. Could attract Google, AWS, Microsoft to set up massive operations in India.\nWhat Disappointed Me ❌ 1. No Income Tax Relief The biggest disappointment. Middle class was hoping for:\nStandard deduction increase (stayed at ₹75,000) Tax slab changes (nothing) Rebate limit hike (nope) As someone earning ₹15-20 lakh annually, I see zero direct benefit in my paycheck. That stings.\n2. F\u0026O Trading Costs I get why they did it (curb speculation), but 5x increase in STT on futures? That’s harsh. Many retail traders will feel this pinch.\n3. MGNREGA Slash Cutting rural employment budget by 65% seems risky. Rural economy is already stressed. This could backfire politically.\n4. Northeast Ignored UNNATI scheme for Northeast got only ₹50 crore (vs ₹10,000 crore announced earlier). That’s disappointing for the entire region.\n5. Nothing for Senior Citizens No special announcements. Tax exemption limits unchanged. Many retirees were hoping for something.\nThe “Meh” Stuff ⚖️ 1. Compliance Improvements ITR filing deadline extended, revised return till March 31 - okay, that’s nice. But not exciting.\n2. New Income Tax Act 2025 Supposedly simpler from April 1, 2026. We’ll see. I’ve heard “simpler tax law” promises before.\n3. Tourism Development Training 10,000 tourist guides, developing archaeological sites - good initiatives, but not game-changers.\nWhat This Means for YOU (By Category) Let me break this down by who you are:\nIf You’re a Salaried Employee (Like Most of Us) The Reality:\n❌ No tax relief ✅ Easier compliance (new IT Act, extended deadlines) ✅ Some goods cheaper (phones, gold) What you should do:\nDon’t expect a bigger paycheck Review your tax regime choice (old vs new) Plan investments for next year Take advantage of extended ITR deadline My advice: Focus on upskilling. This budget signals growth in infrastructure, semiconductors, digital economy. Position yourself for those opportunities.\nIf You’re an Investor Stock Market:\n⚠️ F\u0026O traders: Rethink your strategy (costs up 5x) ✅ Long-term investors: Infrastructure spending is positive ⚠️ Buyback tax changed (slightly negative) Gold/Silver:\n✅ Lower duty = Better entry point ⚠️ Wait 2-3 weeks for stability Strategy: Buy in phases, don’t try to time the bottom Real Estate:\n✅ Infrastructure spending = Better connectivity ✅ Tier-II/III city focus = New opportunities Think: Cities getting high-speed rail connections My portfolio approach: I have mixed allocation of Indian stocks, mutual funds, gold ETFs and US stocks (diversification), now I’m looking at adding few Indian datacenter and semiconductor stocks (very few stocks are available compared to US). Also considering adding more gold through Gold ETFs when prices stabilize.\nIf You’re a Student Opportunities:\nSemiconductor sector = 83,000+ new jobs Tourism = 10,000 trained guides needed Infrastructure = Lakhs of engineering jobs Digital/data centers = Tech roles What you should learn:\nChip design (if electronics/CS) Data center management Construction project management Digital skills (always) Foreign education: Lower TCS makes it slightly cheaper. Plan accordingly.\nMy students often ask: “Which field has jobs?” Right now? Semiconductors, infrastructure, digital economy. That’s where the money’s going.\nIf You’re a Business Owner SME Owners:\n✅ ₹10,000 crore SME Growth Fund ✅ Better credit access ✅ Cluster development support Manufacturers:\n✅ Input costs reduced (electronics, leather, textiles) ✅ Export timeline extended (6 → 12 months) ⚠️ Some machinery duty exemptions removed Action items:\nCheck SME fund eligibility immediately Review input costs (might have reduced) Explore export opportunities Prepare for new Income Tax Act (April 1) If You Have a Wedding Coming Up Good news:\nGold cheaper by ₹3,500-4,200 per 10g Silver down ₹4,500/kg But prices are volatile right now Strategy:\nApril-May weddings: Start buying in late Feb/early March Later weddings: Wait and watch Don’t buy everything at once - phase your purchases If You’re Planning Foreign Travel Study Abroad:\nLower TCS = Less upfront payment Still need to plan finances carefully Consider this in overall budget Tourism:\nLower TCS on tour packages Personal imports cheaper (20%→10%) The Things Nobody’s Talking About Here are some under-reported aspects:\n1. Data Center Tax Holiday Till 2047 This is MASSIVE. Foreign companies setting up cloud data centers in India get tax exemption for 21 years!\nWhat this means:\nGoogle Cloud, AWS, Microsoft will expand aggressively Thousands of tech jobs India becomes a global data center hub For tech professionals: Data center skills = high demand, high pay.\n2. Rare Earth Mineral Corridors Four corridors announced in:\nOdisha Tamil Nadu Andhra Pradesh Kerala Why it matters: Rare earths are critical for EVs, electronics, defence equipment. We import most of it currently. Being self-reliant changes the game.\n3. The MGNREGA Transition Risk Everyone’s focused on the budget cut, but the real story is the transition to a new program (VB-G RAM G).\nRisk: If implementation is poor, millions of rural workers suffer.\nOpportunity: If done well, better quality rural employment.\nThis is a watch-and-wait situation.\n4. Buyback Tax Change Technical but important: Companies might start giving dividends instead of buybacks. Changes your tax liability as an investor.\nBefore: Company paid tax, you got buyback proceeds clean\nAfter: You pay capital gains tax on buyback\nNot the end of the world, but affects your net returns.\nMy Personal Take (As Someone Who Actually Invests) Full transparency: I have invested in Indian stocks and mutual funds and now looking to invest mostly in US stocks through INDMoney (diversification + higher returns historically). I also hold some gold ETFs and small physical gold.\nWhat I’m doing post-budget:\n1. Watching Semiconductor Stocks ₹40,000 crore is serious money. Companies in this space (or supplying to this sector) could see growth. Researching which ones to add to watchlist.\n2. Reconsidering My Investment Strategy I occasionally invest in US markets. The STT increase, no reduction in LTCG, STCG in India, makes me shift investment (at least some amount) to US markets where growth triggers are playing well But this affects my India portfolio strategy.\n3. Gold Allocation Planning to add more gold through gold ETFs when prices stabilize (3-4 weeks). Current allocation is maybe 8%, want to take it to 10-12%. Budget duty cut + global crash = Decent entry point if I’m patient.\nWhat You Should Do This Week Practical action steps:\nEveryone: Monday (Tomorrow):\nCheck if items you buy got cheaper/costlier Read your industry-specific impact Share this article with family (they’ll have questions!) This Week:\nReview your tax regime choice Check if any budget schemes apply to you Update financial planning for 2026-27 Investors: Immediate:\nReview F\u0026O strategy (if you trade derivatives) Research infrastructure stocks Check semiconductor sector opportunities Plan gold purchases (wait 2-3 weeks though) Business Owners: This Month:\nCheck SME Growth Fund eligibility Review customs duty impact on inputs Explore export benefits (extended timeline) Prepare for Income Tax Act 2025 (April 1) Students: Career Planning:\nExplore semiconductor/chip design courses Look into infrastructure project management Upskill in data center technologies Plan foreign education budget (if applicable) The Honest FAQs Nobody Else Answers Q: Will my salary increase because of this budget?\nA: No. Zero. Zilch. Unless your company decides to give you a raise (unrelated to budget), your take-home stays same. Tax slabs didn’t change.\nQ: Should I buy gold right now?\nA: Not right this second. Prices are super volatile. Wait 2-4 weeks for things to settle, then start buying gradually if you need it for wedding or investment.\nQ: Is F\u0026O trading dead now?\nA: Not dead, but definitely more expensive. If you’re a casual trader making a few trades a month, impact is manageable. If you’re doing 50 trades a day, this hurts bad.\nQ: Will phone prices actually drop?\nA: Eventually, yes. Duty relief on components should translate to ₹500-1,000 lower prices on mid-range phones. But give it a month or two for companies to adjust pricing.\nQ: Should I switch from old to new tax regime?\nA: Depends entirely on your situation. I’m using new regime (no home loan, minimal deductions). But if you have home loan + maxed out 80C, old regime might be better. Calculate both!\nQ: Is this a good budget for middle class?\nA: Honestly? It’s “meh” for middle class. Healthcare relief is good if you need cancer treatment. Electronics slightly cheaper. But no direct tax relief. So… disappointing for most salaried folks.\nResources If You Want to Dig Deeper Official Sources:\nFull Budget Document - If you have insomnia Finance Bill 2026 PDF - For the lawyers among us Income Tax Department - Official portal Better Analysis:\nBusiness Standard Budget Coverage (good charts) KPMG India Budget Analysis (technical but thorough) ClearTax Budget Explainer (simple language) Tools:\nClearTax Tax Calculator - Updated for 2026 Income Tax Dept Calculator - Official tool Final Thoughts (The Real Talk) Look, I’m not going to sugarcoat this. Union Budget 2026 is a growth and manufacturing focused budget with some healthcare relief. It’s good for long-term economic development - semiconductors, infrastructure, digital economy.\nBut for the average salaried person? It’s not exciting. No tax relief. Some things got cheaper (which is nice), some got costlier (which isn’t).\nThe real benefits are 5-10 years out:\nBetter infrastructure More jobs Self-reliant semiconductor manufacturing Digital economy growth Today’s pain points remain:\nNo extra money in paycheck F\u0026O trading more expensive Rural employment concerns My advice: Don’t get too excited or too disappointed. Budget is one piece of the economic puzzle. Focus on what you can control:\nYour skills Your investments Your financial planning Your career choices The opportunities are there (semiconductors, infrastructure, digital). Position yourself to take advantage of them.\nAnd remember: This analysis is based on budget announcements. Actual implementation? That’s where things get interesting. We’ll see how much actually happens vs how much was just speech.\nImportant Disclaimer (The Legal Stuff) Okay, serious mode for a minute:\nI’m an Assistant professor, not a financial advisor.

Here&rsquo;s What You Need to Know.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#so-budget-2026-happened-heres-what-you-need-to-know>#</a></h2><p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman just presented her 9th consecutive budget yesterday (February 1, 2026) - and fun fact, it&rsquo;s the first Sunday budget presentation since 1999! I spent the entire evening going through the budget documents, watching the speech, and honestly&mldr; it&rsquo;s a mixed bag.</p><p>As someone who teaches engineering students and also manages my own investments (Indian stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, US stocks through INDMoney), I wanted to break down what this budget actually means for regular people like us. Not the jargon-heavy analysis you&rsquo;ll find everywhere else, but a straightforward explanation.</p><h3 id=the-numbers-that-actually-matter>The Numbers That Actually Matter<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-numbers-that-actually-matter>#</a></h3><p>Here&rsquo;s what you should care about:</p><table><thead><tr><th>What</th><th>Amount</th><th>My Take</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Budget</td><td>₹51 lakh crore</td><td>Massive, but that&rsquo;s expected</td></tr><tr><td>Defence Spending</td><td>₹7.85 lakh crore</td><td>+15% increase - border tensions with Pakistan</td></tr><tr><td>Infrastructure</td><td>₹12.2 lakh crore</td><td>Good for long-term growth</td></tr><tr><td>Semiconductor Push</td><td>₹40,000 crore</td><td>Finally! We need this</td></tr><tr><td>Fiscal Deficit</td><td>4.3% of GDP</td><td>Slightly better than last year</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>The TL;DR:</strong> Growth-focused budget with healthcare relief, but no tax cuts for middle class. Some things got cheaper, some got costlier.</p><hr><h2 id=whats-getting-cheaper-the-good-stuff>What&rsquo;s Getting CHEAPER (The Good Stuff)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whats-getting-cheaper-the-good-stuff>#</a></h2><h3 id=1-cancer-medicines---this-is-huge>1. Cancer Medicines - This is HUGE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-cancer-medicines---this-is-huge>#</a></h3><p>Look, I&rsquo;ve seen colleagues and friends struggle with cancer treatment costs. The financial burden is brutal - often ₹5-15 lakhs annually. So when the FM announced that <strong>17 cancer drugs will now be duty-free</strong>, I actually felt relieved for so many families.</p><p><strong>What this means in real money:</strong></p><ul><li>Before: Import duty made these drugs 10-15% more expensive</li><li>After: Direct savings of ₹50,000 to ₹2 lakh per patient per year</li><li>Also: 7 more rare diseases added to duty-free list</li></ul><p>This isn&rsquo;t just about money - it&rsquo;s about accessibility. More people can now afford life-saving treatment.</p><h3 id=2-electronics---your-next-phone-might-be-cheaper>2. Electronics - Your Next Phone Might Be Cheaper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-electronics---your-next-phone-might-be-cheaper>#</a></h3><p>As an electronics professor, I&rsquo;m pretty excited about this one. The government reduced customs duty on components for manufacturing mobile phones and tablets.</p><p><strong>Expected impact:</strong></p><ul><li>Mid-range phones: ₹500-1,000 cheaper</li><li>Example: A ₹15,000 phone might cost ₹14,000</li><li>Microwave ovens: About ₹500-800 cheaper</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s not revolutionary, but hey, every rupee saved counts when you&rsquo;re buying gadgets for the family.</p><h3 id=3-gold--silver---wedding-shoppers-listen-up>3. Gold & Silver - Wedding Shoppers, Listen Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-gold--silver---wedding-shoppers-listen-up>#</a></h3><p>Import duty dropped from 6% to 5%. Now, I know that sounds tiny, but when you&rsquo;re buying gold for a wedding, it adds up:</p><ul><li><strong>Gold jewelry savings:</strong> ₹3,500-4,200 per 10 grams</li><li><strong>Silver:</strong> ₹4,500 cheaper per kg</li></ul><p><strong>My advice?</strong> Wait 2-3 weeks for prices to stabilize. There was a massive global crash in precious metals prices just before the budget (gold fell 11%, silver crashed 35%!). So the timing is actually not bad for wedding shoppers.</p><h3 id=4-foreign-travel--education-got-easier-on-your-wallet>4. Foreign Travel & Education Got Easier on Your Wallet<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-foreign-travel--education-got-easier-on-your-wallet>#</a></h3><p>The TCS (Tax Collected at Source) has been reduced for:</p><ul><li>Foreign tour packages</li><li>Education expenses abroad</li><li>Medical treatment overseas</li></ul><p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> If you&rsquo;re sending your kid abroad for education, you&rsquo;ll pay less TCS upfront. More money in your pocket initially.</p><h3 id=5-personal-imports---halved>5. Personal Imports - Halved!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-personal-imports---halved>#</a></h3><p>This is interesting. Customs duty on goods imported for personal use was cut from 20% to 10%.</p><p><strong>Practical scenario:</strong> If your relative brings you an iPhone from Dubai, you&rsquo;ll pay half the duty you used to. Could save ₹10,000-15,000 on high-value items.</p><h3 id=6-some-other-stuff-that-got-cheaper>6. Some Other Stuff That Got Cheaper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-some-other-stuff-that-got-cheaper>#</a></h3><ul><li>Solar panels (duty cuts on parts)</li><li>Leather products (raw material duty reduced)</li><li>EV battery components</li><li>Textile exports (more time to ship)</li></ul><hr><h2 id=whats-getting-costlier-the-not-so-good-stuff>What&rsquo;s Getting COSTLIER (The Not-So-Good Stuff)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whats-getting-costlier-the-not-so-good-stuff>#</a></h2><h3 id=1-fo-trading-just-got-expensive>1. F&amp;O Trading Just Got EXPENSIVE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-fo-trading-just-got-expensive>#</a></h3><p>Okay, this one hit me because I dabble in options occasionally (mostly US markets, but still). The Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been increased dramatically:</p><table><thead><tr><th>What</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Futures</td><td>0.01%</td><td>0.05%</td><td><strong>5x higher</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Options Premium</td><td>0.10%</td><td>0.15%</td><td>1.5x higher</td></tr><tr><td>Options Exercise</td><td>0.125%</td><td>0.15%</td><td>1.2x higher</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Why&rsquo;d they do this?</strong> The government says F&amp;O trading volume is 500 times India&rsquo;s GDP. That&rsquo;s&mldr; insane. They&rsquo;re trying to curb excessive speculation.</p><p><strong>Impact on you:</strong> If you&rsquo;re a frequent F&amp;O trader, your costs just jumped significantly. Time to rethink that intraday strategy.</p><h3 id=2-cigarettes-tobacco-alcohol---sin-taxes-up>2. Cigarettes, Tobacco, Alcohol - Sin Taxes Up<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-cigarettes-tobacco-alcohol---sin-taxes-up>#</a></h3><p>No surprises here. The government increased excise duty on:</p><ul><li>Cigarettes: About ₹5-10 more per pack</li><li>Pan masala & tobacco: 10-15% price hike</li><li>Alcohol: Varies by state, but expect 5-8% increase</li></ul><p>Honestly? This is probably a good thing from a public health perspective, even if smokers and drinkers won&rsquo;t be happy.</p><h3 id=3-corporate-buybacks---shareholders-now-pay-tax>3. Corporate Buybacks - Shareholders Now Pay Tax<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-corporate-buybacks---shareholders-now-pay-tax>#</a></h3><p>This is technical, but important if you invest in stocks:</p><p><strong>Old system:</strong> Company paid tax on buyback<br><strong>New system:</strong> Shareholders pay capital gains tax (22% for corporate, 30% for non-corporate)</p><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Companies might do fewer buybacks, or shareholders get less net benefit.</p><h3 id=4-some-imported-luxury-goods>4. Some Imported Luxury Goods<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-some-imported-luxury-goods>#</a></h3><p>Professional cameras, TV broadcast equipment, and filmmaking gear will attract higher taxes. The logic? Promote &ldquo;Make in India&rdquo; for electronics.</p><p>Also, fertilizer input costs might rise (duty exemptions removed), though the government subsidizes most of it anyway.</p><hr><h2 id=wheres-all-the-money-going>Where&rsquo;s All The Money Going?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#wheres-all-the-money-going>#</a></h2><p>Alright, here&rsquo;s where your tax money is being spent. I&rsquo;ll focus on the big-ticket items:</p><h3 id=1-defence-785-lakh-crore-15>1. Defence: ₹7.85 Lakh Crore (+15%)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-defence-785-lakh-crore-15>#</a></h3><p>Given the recent tensions with Pakistan, this makes sense. More money for:</p><ul><li>Military modernization</li><li>Border infrastructure</li><li>Equipment upgrades</li><li>Personnel welfare</li></ul><p>As an Indian, I&rsquo;m okay with this. Security isn&rsquo;t negotiable.</p><h3 id=2-infrastructure-122-lakh-crore-9>2. Infrastructure: ₹12.2 Lakh Crore (+9%)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-infrastructure-122-lakh-crore-9>#</a></h3><p>This is where things get interesting. Seven new high-speed rail corridors:</p><ul><li>Mumbai-Pune</li><li>Pune-Hyderabad</li><li>Hyderabad-Bengaluru</li><li>Delhi-Varanasi</li><li>Others&mldr;</li></ul><p><strong>My take:</strong> Great for long-term connectivity, but these projects take 5-10 years. Don&rsquo;t expect high-speed trains next year.</p><p>Also, focus on Tier-II and Tier-III cities (population > 5 lakh). Smart move - that&rsquo;s where growth is happening.</p><h3 id=3-semiconductors-40000-crore>3. Semiconductors: ₹40,000 Crore<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-semiconductors-40000-crore>#</a></h3><p><strong>Finally!</strong> India Semiconductor Mission 2.0 is here. We&rsquo;re going to try and become a chip manufacturing hub.</p><p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Remember the chip shortage during COVID? Every smartphone, car, and gadget needs semiconductors. Being self-reliant is critical.</p><p><strong>For students:</strong> If you&rsquo;re in electronics or computer science, semiconductor design is going to be a HOT career field. Companies will be hiring like crazy.</p><h3 id=4-sme-growth-fund-10000-crore>4. SME Growth Fund: ₹10,000 Crore<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-sme-growth-fund-10000-crore>#</a></h3><p>Small and medium enterprises are getting ₹10,000 crore in funding. Performance-linked incentives, better credit access, cluster development.</p><p><strong>If you&rsquo;re a small business owner:</strong> Look into this. Could be a game-changer for your business.</p><h3 id=5-education-128-lakh-crore-6>5. Education: ₹1.28 Lakh Crore (+6%)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-education-128-lakh-crore-6>#</a></h3><p>As an educator, I&rsquo;m cautiously optimistic:</p><ul><li>Girls&rsquo; hostels in every district (good!)</li><li>University townships near industrial hubs</li><li>Skill development programs expanded</li></ul><p>But honestly? We need more. Much more. Our education system needs a complete overhaul, not just 6% budget increase.</p><h3 id=6-rural-employment---this-is-controversial>6. Rural Employment - This is Controversial<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-rural-employment---this-is-controversial>#</a></h3><p>MGNREGA (rural employment guarantee scheme) budget was <strong>slashed by 65%</strong> - from ₹86,000 crore to ₹30,000 crore.</p><p><strong>Why?</strong> They&rsquo;re transitioning to a new program called VB-G RAM G (allocated ₹95,692 crore).</p><p><strong>Concern:</strong> Will the transition be smooth? Farmer groups are already unhappy. This could be politically tricky.</p><hr><h2 id=the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh>The Good, The Bad, and The &ldquo;Meh&rdquo;<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh>#</a></h2><h3 id=what-i-liked->What I Liked ✅<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-i-liked->#</a></h3><p><strong>1. Healthcare Focus</strong>
17 cancer drugs duty-free is genuinely helpful. I&rsquo;ve seen what cancer treatment costs do to families. This will save lives - literally.</p><p><strong>2. Manufacturing Push</strong>
Semiconductors, electronics components, rare earth corridors - we&rsquo;re finally serious about becoming a manufacturing hub. About time!</p><p><strong>3. Fiscal Discipline</strong>
Deficit at 4.3% shows the government isn&rsquo;t going on a spending spree. Long-term, this is good for economic stability.</p><p><strong>4. Infrastructure Spending</strong>
₹12.2 lakh crore on infrastructure = jobs, jobs, jobs. Engineering students graduating in next 2-3 years will have good opportunities.</p><p><strong>5. Digital Push</strong>
Tax holiday for data centers till 2047! That&rsquo;s bold. Could attract Google, AWS, Microsoft to set up massive operations in India.</p><h3 id=what-disappointed-me->What Disappointed Me ❌<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-disappointed-me->#</a></h3><p><strong>1. No Income Tax Relief</strong>
The biggest disappointment. Middle class was hoping for:</p><ul><li>Standard deduction increase (stayed at ₹75,000)</li><li>Tax slab changes (nothing)</li><li>Rebate limit hike (nope)</li></ul><p>As someone earning ₹15-20 lakh annually, I see zero direct benefit in my paycheck. That stings.</p><p><strong>2. F&amp;O Trading Costs</strong>
I get why they did it (curb speculation), but 5x increase in STT on futures? That&rsquo;s harsh. Many retail traders will feel this pinch.</p><p><strong>3. MGNREGA Slash</strong>
Cutting rural employment budget by 65% seems risky. Rural economy is already stressed. This could backfire politically.</p><p><strong>4. Northeast Ignored</strong>
UNNATI scheme for Northeast got only ₹50 crore (vs ₹10,000 crore announced earlier). That&rsquo;s disappointing for the entire region.</p><p><strong>5. Nothing for Senior Citizens</strong>
No special announcements. Tax exemption limits unchanged. Many retirees were hoping for something.</p><h3 id=the-meh-stuff->The &ldquo;Meh&rdquo; Stuff ⚖️<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-meh-stuff->#</a></h3><p><strong>1. Compliance Improvements</strong>
ITR filing deadline extended, revised return till March 31 - okay, that&rsquo;s nice. But not exciting.</p><p><strong>2. New Income Tax Act 2025</strong>
Supposedly simpler from April 1, 2026. We&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;simpler tax law&rdquo; promises before.</p><p><strong>3. Tourism Development</strong>
Training 10,000 tourist guides, developing archaeological sites - good initiatives, but not game-changers.</p><hr><h2 id=what-this-means-for-you-by-category>What This Means for YOU (By Category)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-this-means-for-you-by-category>#</a></h2><p>Let me break this down by who you are:</p><h3 id=if-youre-a-salaried-employee-like-most-of-us>If You&rsquo;re a Salaried Employee (Like Most of Us)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#if-youre-a-salaried-employee-like-most-of-us>#</a></h3><p><strong>The Reality:</strong></p><ul><li>❌ No tax relief</li><li>✅ Easier compliance (new IT Act, extended deadlines)</li><li>✅ Some goods cheaper (phones, gold)</li></ul><p><strong>What you should do:</strong></p><ol><li>Don&rsquo;t expect a bigger paycheck</li><li>Review your tax regime choice (old vs new)</li><li>Plan investments for next year</li><li>Take advantage of extended ITR deadline</li></ol><p><strong>My advice:</strong> Focus on upskilling. This budget signals growth in infrastructure, semiconductors, digital economy. Position yourself for those opportunities.</p><h3 id=if-youre-an-investor>If You&rsquo;re an Investor<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#if-youre-an-investor>#</a></h3><p><strong>Stock Market:</strong></p><ul><li>⚠️ F&amp;O traders: Rethink your strategy (costs up 5x)</li><li>✅ Long-term investors: Infrastructure spending is positive</li><li>⚠️ Buyback tax changed (slightly negative)</li></ul><p><strong>Gold/Silver:</strong></p><ul><li>✅ Lower duty = Better entry point</li><li>⚠️ Wait 2-3 weeks for stability</li><li>Strategy: Buy in phases, don&rsquo;t try to time the bottom</li></ul><p><strong>Real Estate:</strong></p><ul><li>✅ Infrastructure spending = Better connectivity</li><li>✅ Tier-II/III city focus = New opportunities</li><li>Think: Cities getting high-speed rail connections</li></ul><p><strong>My portfolio approach:</strong> I have mixed allocation of Indian stocks, mutual funds, gold ETFs and US stocks (diversification), now I&rsquo;m looking at adding few Indian datacenter and semiconductor stocks (very few stocks are available compared to US).

I also hold some gold ETFs and small physical gold.</p><p><strong>What I&rsquo;m doing post-budget:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Watching Semiconductor Stocks</strong>
₹40,000 crore is serious money. Companies in this space (or supplying to this sector) could see growth. Researching which ones to add to watchlist.</p><p><strong>2. Reconsidering My Investment Strategy</strong>
I occasionally invest in US markets. The STT increase, no reduction in LTCG, STCG in India, makes me shift investment (at least some amount) to US markets where growth triggers are playing well But this affects my India portfolio strategy.</p><p><strong>3. Gold Allocation</strong>
Planning to add more gold through gold ETFs when prices stabilize (3-4 weeks). Current allocation is maybe 8%, want to take it to 10-12%. Budget duty cut + global crash = Decent entry point if I&rsquo;m patient.</p><hr><h2 id=what-you-should-do-this-week>What You Should Do This Week<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-you-should-do-this-week>#</a></h2><p>Practical action steps:</p><h3 id=everyone>Everyone:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#everyone>#</a></h3><p><strong>Monday (Tomorrow):</strong></p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Check if items you buy got cheaper/costlier</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Read your industry-specific impact</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Share this article with family (they&rsquo;ll have questions!)</li></ul><p><strong>This Week:</strong></p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Review your tax regime choice</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Check if any budget schemes apply to you</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Update financial planning for 2026-27</li></ul><h3 id=investors>Investors:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#investors>#</a></h3><p><strong>Immediate:</strong></p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Review F&amp;O strategy (if you trade derivatives)</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Research infrastructure stocks</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Check semiconductor sector opportunities</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Plan gold purchases (wait 2-3 weeks though)</li></ul><h3 id=business-owners>Business Owners:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#business-owners>#</a></h3><p><strong>This Month:</strong></p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Check SME Growth Fund eligibility</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Review customs duty impact on inputs</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Explore export benefits (extended timeline)</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Prepare for Income Tax Act 2025 (April 1)</li></ul><h3 id=students>Students:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#students>#</a></h3><p><strong>Career Planning:</strong></p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Explore semiconductor/chip design courses</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Look into infrastructure project management</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Upskill in data center technologies</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Plan foreign education budget (if applicable)</li></ul><hr><h2 id=the-honest-faqs-nobody-else-answers>The Honest FAQs Nobody Else Answers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-honest-faqs-nobody-else-answers>#</a></h2><p><strong>Q: Will my salary increase because of this budget?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No. Zero. Zilch. Unless your company decides to give you a raise (unrelated to budget), your take-home stays same. Tax slabs didn&rsquo;t change.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I buy gold right now?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Not right this second. Prices are super volatile. Wait 2-4 weeks for things to settle, then start buying gradually if you need it for wedding or investment.</p><p><strong>Q: Is F&amp;O trading dead now?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Not dead, but definitely more expensive. If you&rsquo;re a casual trader making a few trades a month, impact is manageable. If you&rsquo;re doing 50 trades a day, this hurts bad.</p><p><strong>Q: Will phone prices actually drop?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Eventually, yes. Duty relief on components should translate to ₹500-1,000 lower prices on mid-range phones. But give it a month or two for companies to adjust pricing.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I switch from old to new tax regime?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Depends entirely on your situation. I&rsquo;m using new regime (no home loan, minimal deductions). But if you have home loan + maxed out 80C, old regime might be better. Calculate both!</p><p><strong>Q: Is this a good budget for middle class?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Honestly? It&rsquo;s &ldquo;meh&rdquo; for middle class. Healthcare relief is good if you need cancer treatment. Electronics slightly cheaper. But no direct tax relief. So&mldr; disappointing for most salaried folks.</p><hr><h2 id=resources-if-you-want-to-dig-deeper>Resources If You Want to Dig Deeper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#resources-if-you-want-to-dig-deeper>#</a></h2><p><strong>Official Sources:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=https://www.indiabudget.gov.in>Full Budget Document</a> - If you have insomnia</li><li><a href=https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Finance_Bill.pdf>Finance Bill 2026 PDF</a> - For the lawyers among us</li><li><a href=https://www.incometax.gov.in>Income Tax Department</a> - Official portal</li></ul><p><strong>Better Analysis:</strong></p><ul><li>Business Standard Budget Coverage (good charts)</li><li>KPMG India Budget Analysis (technical but thorough)</li><li>ClearTax Budget Explainer (simple language)</li></ul><p><strong>Tools:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=https://cleartax.in/paytax/taxcalculator>ClearTax Tax Calculator</a> - Updated for 2026</li><li>Income Tax Dept Calculator - Official tool</li></ul><hr><h2 id=final-thoughts-the-real-talk>Final Thoughts (The Real Talk)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#final-thoughts-the-real-talk>#</a></h2><p>Look, I&rsquo;m not going to sugarcoat this. Union Budget 2026 is a growth and manufacturing focused budget with some healthcare relief. It&rsquo;s good for long-term economic development - semiconductors, infrastructure, digital economy.</p><p><strong>But for the average salaried person?</strong> It&rsquo;s not exciting. No tax relief.
